# Face Detection App API

## ðŸ‘‰[**Try it out here\***](https://a-hr-nikolov.github.io/face-detection-app/)

\***NOTE**: Server hosted on **Render.com** and kept up by a **cron-job.org** service. If the latter is down, the server will take a minute or two to restart after the initial request to it is made.

The back-end of the Face Detection App I have in my repository. It creates a simple server that defines several REST endpoints for a vary basic CRUD app with a DBMS (PostgreSQL) integration.

**Front-end repo:** https://github.com/a-hr-nikolov/face-detection-app

## Technologies used on the back-end

- Node.js + Express.js
- Argon2 Hashing Library
- PostgreSQL
- Knex.js (for building SQL queries)
