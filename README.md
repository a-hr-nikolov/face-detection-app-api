# Face Detection App API

The back-end of the Face Detection App I have in my repository. It creates a simple server that defines several endpoints for a vary basic CRUD app with DB (PostgreSQL) integration.

**Front-end repo:** https://github.com/a-hr-nikolov/face-detection-app

## Technologies used on the back-end

- Node.js + Express.js
- Argon2 Hashing Library
- PostgreSQL
- Knex.js (for building SQL queries)
