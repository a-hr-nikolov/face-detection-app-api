# Face Detection App API

The back-end of the Face Detection App I have in my repository. It includes a simple server that handles several requests, stores items in a database (currently committed without it, DB still under development).

## Technologies used on the back-end

- Node.js + Express.js
- Argon2 Hashing Library
- PostgreSQL (to be implemented)
